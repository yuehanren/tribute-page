            <h2 id="tl">Here is a time line of Jackie Chan's life:</h2>
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li><strong>1954-</strong>Chan was born on 7 April 1954, in Hong Kong.</li>
              <li><strong>1976-</strong>ackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong
                film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stunt work. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. </li>
              <li><strong>1978-</strong>Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot
                 while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal. Director Yuen Woo-ping allowed Chan complete freedom over
                 his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved refreshing to the Hong Kong audience. Chan then starred
                 in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.</li>
              <li><strong>1980-</strong>Willie Chan became Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years. He was
                instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry. His first
                Hollywood film was The Big Brawl.</li>
              <li><strong>1988-</strong>Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date, in the film Dragons Forever.
                Hung co-directed with Corey Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the
                China Drama Academy.</li>
              <li><strong>2012-</strong>While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that
                he was getting too old for the genre. He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but would be
                performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.</li>
              <li><strong>2015-</strong>Chan was awarded the title of "Datuk" by Malaysia as he helped Malaysia to boost its tourism, especially
                in Kuala Lumpur where he previously shot his films.[60] Upcoming films include the Chinese-Indian project titled "Kung Fu Yoga"
                which also stars Sonu Sood and Amyra Dastur. The film also reunites Chan with director Stanley Tong, who directed a number of
                Chan's films in the 1990s.</li>
